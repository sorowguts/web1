  The title "Mobility immobility" suggests that the time and space of the exhibition is a kind of snapshot, recording a moment in the process of exchange, the flow of ideas that is central to the Echangeur22 project.
The works-in-progress presented here were created as part of the fifth edition of the residency by French duo Comma (Clémence Choquet and Mickaël Gamio), Japanese artist Shusuke Nishimatsu, South Korean artist Sanghee Noh, and Ursula Tautz, who lives and works in Brazil.
The bells that rythmically mark out the village's memories (Ursula Tautz); the Mistral wind carrying dust from distant lands (Sanghee Noh); the stones of Tavel and the silkworms traded by the Carthusian monks (Comma); the Pont d'Avignon, a pair of chopsticks, and a round of cheese (Shusuke Nishimatsu) are so many starting points for a series of imaginary journeys, which in turn interrogate popular culture, the flow of time, the surprising connections between the Chartreuse and Asia, and the art of translation as a link between languages and cultures, as imperfect as it is creative.
